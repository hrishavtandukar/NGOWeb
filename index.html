                          <p>The Village Chukha is also identified under the name "Sarsunkharka VDC-7" region Kavre which is represented by the mayor, Mr. Salam Singh Tamang. It is the village located to the east of Kathmandu valley, which is mostly inhabitant to the Tamang ethnicity of about 30 families on the upper part of the (chukha or Laukhani) and with 58 families on the Lower Chukha or Goth Danda. The inhabitant of the Chukha village are obliged to supply water from the spring at the altitude of 1340m at the bottom of the valley with extremely steepy slopes. The only options is to carry the drinking water with the means of walk on the steep slope of about three hours with a 20-liter (for children) and load of 40-liter (for adults). The water problem became worse after the devastating earthquake in April 25th 2015, which also drained the spring the only nearest source of water in the village. To solve this problem Mr. Shankar Man Tamang formed an assosciation named Lhahyul Chhyorten Helping Hand to initate a project. This project consists of the two parts: one for the Lower part (Lower Chukha or Croth Danda) and another one is Upper part (Upper Chukha or Laukhani). The first part of the project has been funded by the organization and implemented which is currently in the operation since April 5th 2017. The donation for the first part was made by French Organizations with 50,000 euros and the local villagers has voluntarily helped for the laying of the pipes and their reinterments, excavation of tank foundation construction of storage tanks. The second part of the project has also started with the help of the Italian Organization Cecy Onlus. We have co-operated with French associations Eau Pour Chukha Nepal (Founder: Ghisline Roche) and Cecy Onlus (Founder: Poal Craveri).</p>

						<p class="subtitle"><h4>Problem Scenario<br> "The village of Chukha"</h4></p>
                     	<p class="subtitle"> Chukha Village is located on the rural part of the Kavre district. In this region infrastructures of development has been in less touch than in the other sector, specially in the education sector. There is only one school on the lower Chukha village "Shree Sarbo Ddhar Secondary School". This school hasn't been able to provide proper education to the students. The buildings of the school aren't well organized. The surrounding of the school isn't surrounded by the walls. There aren't enough qualified personnel for teaching the students. So, the buildings should be organized within the surroundings and well educated professionals should be hired for the proper educational. It helps them to learn in the suitable environment and develop in many personal skills. By building the wall around the school, the problems like domestic animals entering the school surroundings and the ill behaved peoples disturbing the school could be avoided.</p>

                        	<p class="subtitle">On April 25th 2015 a devastating earthquake hit Nepal with 7.8 magnitude. It caused a lot of destruction on the various sectors of the himalayan and hilly region. It also caused huge number of people to lose their lives along with their houses and shelter. Again on May 12th 2015 the strong aftershock wave of 6.8 magnitude hit us again. The earthquake caused extensive damage to the historical buildings. The earthquake was followed by more than 430 aftershocks and nearly 8000 peoples lost their lives. The help needed was provided by the social organization from all over the world and neighbouring countries but some of the rural areas didn't get the help. Similarly, the people of Chukha village were having trouble since they were homeless and they were troubled by many common diseases due to unsanitary living. Lhahyul Chhyorten Helping Hand with association of French Organization (Eau Pour Chukha Nepal), organized a programme for distributing tent for 300 families to build temporary houses and also provided medical attention and distribuition of medicines.   </p>

						<h4>Words of Shankar Man Tamang</h4>
                        <h5>CEO</h5>

						<p class="subtitle"><h5>  Founder of Lhahyul Chhyorten Helping Hand</h5></p>
                   		<p>Founded in 2070 B.S. (2013 A.D.) by MR. Shankar Man Tamang, Lhahyul Chhyorten Helping Hand has been organizing various programms and campaign in social and economical development in Neplease society. When the devastating earthquake hit nepal in April 25th 2015 Lhahyul Chhyorten Helping Hand provided the relief serivces to the victims of the earthquake. It was difficult at the beginnig but with the help of foreign French Organization (Eau Pour Chukha Nepal), the Organization helped in distribuiting the medicines, tents, dry-foods, sanitary products(Soap, hand wash), blankets and roofs(Zinc plates) for building temporary shelters to the earthquake victims. The divastating earthquake caused shortage of drinking water in many places of effected regions. By observing the drinking water shortage in many of these places this organization decided, organizing the Chukha Drinking Water project. This project was intended to solve drinking water shortage in the village of Chukha, Kavre. With the help of generous people of Chukha village and hard working people of Eau Pour Chukha Nepal organization, we were able to solve the water shortage in the Chukha village. </p>
