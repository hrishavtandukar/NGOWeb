                          <p>The Village Chukha is also identified under the name "Sarsynkhara VDC-7" region Kavre which is represented by the mayor, Mr Ranjit. It is the village about east of kathmandu, located in the district of kavre, which is mostly inhabitant to the Tamang ethnicity of about 30 families on the upper part of the (chukha or Laukhani) and with 58 families on the Lower Chukha or Goth Danda. The inhabitant of the chukha village are obliged to supply water from the spring at the altitude of 1340m at the bottom of the valley with extremely steepy slopes; The only options is to carry the drinking water with the means of walk on the steep slope of about three hours with a 20-liter(for children) and load of 40 (for adults). The water problem became worse after the devastating earthquake in April 2015, which also drained the spring the only nearest source of water. To solve this problem the Chukha village formed an assosciation named Lhahhyl Chyyorten Helping Hand. The Founder of the Lhhahyul Chhyorten Helping Hand Mr.Shankharman Tamang had a direct contact with french assosciation, THe project consists of the two parts: one for the Lower part (Lower Chukha or Croth Danda) and another one is middle and Upper part (Upper Chukha or Laukhani) The first part of the project has been in funded and implemented and is currently in the operation since February 2017, The second planning is waiting for a lender. The donation for the first part was made by french organizations with 50,000 euros and the local villagers has voluntaringly helped for the laying of the pipes and reinterments, excavation of tank foundation construction of storeage tanks. we have cooperated with french associations Eau Pour Chukha Nepal and Cecy Onlus.</p>
